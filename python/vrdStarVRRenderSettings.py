def getFoveatedFovFactor():
    '''
    Returns the FOV factor used for native foveated rendering.
    '''
    pass



def getFoveatedResolutionScale():
    '''
    Returns the resolution scale factor for the foveated area (high-resolution) used in native foveated rendering mode.
    '''
    pass



def getFrontViewResolutionScale():
    '''
    Returns resolution scale for front viewports.
    '''
    pass



def getNonFoveatedResolutionScale():
    '''
    Returns the resolution scale factor for the pheripheral area (low-resolution) used in native foveated rendering mode.
    '''
    pass



def getSideViewResolutionScale():
    '''
    Returns resolution scale for side viewports.
    '''
    pass



def getUseNativeFoveatedRendering():
    '''
    Return whether native StarVR foveated rendering is used.
    '''
    pass



def getUseSingleTexture():
    '''
    Return whether only one texture per eye is rendered.
    '''
    pass



def setFoveatedFovFactor(fovFactor):
    '''
    Set field of view factor for native foveated rendering. Defines which percentage of the whole FOV per eye is used for the high-resolution area.
    '''
    pass



def setFoveatedResolutionScale(scale):
    '''
    Set resolution scale for foveated area (high-resolution) used in native foveated rendering mode. 1.0 corresponds to 100% (maximum) resolution.
    '''
    pass



def setFrontViewResolutionScale(scale):
    '''
    Set resolution scale for front viewports.
    '''
    pass



def setNonFoveatedResolutionScale(scale):
    '''
    Set resolution scale for pheripheral area (low-resolution) used in native foveated rendering mode.
    '''
    pass



def setSideViewResolutionScale(scale):
    '''
    Set resolution scale for side viewports.
    '''
    pass



def setUseNativeFoveatedRendering(on):
    '''
    Toggle native StarVR foveated rendering. In this mode, the scene is rendered 2 times per eye: once into a larger low resolution viewport for peripheral vision, and once into a smaller high resolution viewport that is moved by eye tracking to the position you’re currently looking at. Change the size of the tracked viewport with         vrdStarVRRenderSettings.setFoveatedFovFactor(fovFactor), and its resolution with vrdStarVRRenderSettings.setFoveatedResolutionScale(scale).
    '''
    pass



def setUseSingleTexture(on):
    '''
    Enable this option to render only one texture per eye, instead of the two ‘front’ and ‘side’ view textures. This option is only applied if native foveated rendering is off.
    '''
    pass



def vrdStarVRRenderSettings():
    '''
    Default constructor.
    '''
    pass



def vrdStarVRRenderSettings(state):
    '''
    Copy constructor.
