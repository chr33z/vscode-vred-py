    Set resolution scale for foveated area (high-resolution) used in native foveated rendering mode. 1.0 corresponds to 100% (maximum) resolution.

def setUseNativeFoveatedRendering(on: bool):
    '''
    Toggle native StarVR foveated rendering. In this mode, the scene is rendered 2 times per eye: once into a larger low resolution viewport for peripheral vision, and once into a smaller high resolution viewport that is moved by eye tracking to the position you’re currently looking at. Change the size of the tracked viewport with         vrdStarVRRenderSettings.setFoveatedFovFactor(fovFactor), and its resolution with vrdStarVRRenderSettings.setFoveatedResolutionScale(scale).

def setUseSingleTexture(on: bool):
    '''
    Enable this option to render only one texture per eye, instead of the two ‘front’ and ‘side’ view textures. This option is only applied if native foveated rendering is off.
