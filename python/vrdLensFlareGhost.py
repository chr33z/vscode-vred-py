------------------------------------------
This class is used for a ghost effect in a ghost line. Ghost are elements that move with the light source. A short introduction can be found under     https://help.autodesk.com/view/VREDPRODUCTS/2020/ENU/?guid=VRED_Lights_About_Lens_Flares_and_Elements_html.

    Use chromatic aberration with the lens flare element to distort the colors.

    '''
    Lens flare effect distance from light source. Must be between -5 and 5. Use a negative value for a position in front of the light source.

    '''
    Makes the edge color of the Ghost Line element more or less intense. Changing it to 0 will make the edge disappear.
    '''

def setEdgeThickness(thickness: float):
    '''
    The thickness of the edges of the Ghost Line element. When Edge Intensity is high, it is much easier to see the difference.

    '''
    Set an image for this ghost element. You have to change the type to Texture to use the image for the ghost.

    '''
    Activate the usage of chromatic aberration.

    '''
    Set a shape for the ghost element.
