from typing import List



def getChromaticAberration():
    '''
    Get used chromatic aberration values as RGB.
    '''
    pass



def getDistance():
    '''
    Get the lens flare effect distance from light source.
    '''
    pass



def getEdgeIntensity():
    '''
    Get the edge color intensity of the Ghost Line element.
    '''
    pass



def getEdgeThickness():
    '''
    Get thickness of the edges of the Ghost Line element.
    '''
    pass



def getImage():
    '''
    Return the current used texture.
    '''
    pass



def getIsChromaticAberrationActive():
    '''
    Get activation state the usage of chromatic aberration.
    '''
    pass



def getShape():
    '''
    Give the current used shape for the ghost element.
    '''
    pass



def setChromaticAberration(chromaticAberration):
    '''
    Use chromatic aberration with the lens flare element to distort the colors.
    '''
    pass



def setDistance(distance):
    '''
    Lens flare effect distance from light source. Must be between -5 and 5. Use a negative value for a position in front of the light source.
    '''
    pass



def setEdgeIntensity(edgeIntensity):
    '''
    Makes the edge color of the Ghost Line element more or less intense. Changing it to 0 will make the edge disappear.
    '''
    pass



def setEdgeThickness(thickness):
    '''
    The thickness of the edges of the Ghost Line element. When Edge Intensity is high, it is much easier to see the difference.
    '''
    pass



def setImage(image):
    '''
    Set an image for this ghost element. You have to change the type to Texture to use the image for the ghost.
    '''
    pass



def setIsChromaticAberrationActive(isActive):
    '''
    Activate the usage of chromatic aberration.
    '''
    pass



def setShape(shape):
    '''
    Set a shape for the ghost element.
    '''
    pass
